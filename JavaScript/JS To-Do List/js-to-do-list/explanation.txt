HTML:
We have an input field (taskInput) where the user can type in a task.
A button to add the task to the list. When this button is clicked, it will call the addTask() function.
An unordered list (taskList) to display the tasks.

JavaScript:
The addTask() function is responsible for creating and adding new tasks:
We first get the taskInput and taskList elements.
If the input is empty, we alert the user and return without doing anything.
We then create a new li element (taskItem) and set its text to the value from the input field.
We also add a delete button for each task, which, when clicked, will remove the task from the list.
Finally, we add the taskItem to the taskList and clear the input field.
