for (var i = 1; i <=3 ; i++) {
    setTimeout(()=> {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}

// The output of this code will be 4, 4, 4. This is because the setTimeout function is asynchronous and the for loop will continue to run while the setTimeout function is waiting to execute. By the time the setTimeout function is executed, the loop will have already finished and the value of i will be 4. To fix this, you can use a closure to preserve the value of i at each iteration:
for (var i = 1; i <=3 ; i++) {
    ((i) => {
        setTimeout(()=> {
            console.log(i);
        }, 1000);
    })(i);
}

// This will output 1, 2, 3, which is probably what we were expecting. The closure preserves the value of i at each iteration, so each setTimeout function references the correct value of i.

// The second and better option is to use let instead of var in the for loop. The let keyword creates a new binding for each iteration of the loop, which solves the problem with var. Here's the updated code using let:
for (let i = 1; i <=3 ; i++) {
    setTimeout(()=> {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}

// This will also output 1, 2, 3.
