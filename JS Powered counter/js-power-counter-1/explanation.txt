With this project, you're going to learn:
Basic HTML structure and how to include a JavaScript file.
How to manipulate variables in JavaScript.
How to define and use functions in JavaScript.
How to interact with HTML elements from JavaScript using the Document Object Model (DOM).

HTML:
First we've set up a simple structure with a number and two buttons.
Each button has an onclick attribute which is connected to a function - these functions will be defined in our JavaScript.

JavaScript:
We have a variable count to keep track of the number.
The increase() function increments the count variable.
The decrease() function decrements the count variable.
After each action (increment or decrement), we call the updateDisplay() function.
updateDisplay() grabs the HTML element with the ID counter and updates its text content with the current value of count.
